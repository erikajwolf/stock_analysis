# Analyzing Stocks with VBA
## Overview of Stock_Analysis
### Steve, Steve's Parents, and DQ
Steve has asked for help, on behalf of his parents, for an analysis of green energy company DAQO (DQ). With their belief that alternative energy is the future, they want to invest in this specific market. Steve, being a good son, wants to make sure they have a diversified portfolio--all in the same green-energy vein--and has compiled 2017 and 2018 stock data to be able to best advise his parents and their investment decisions.
## Results
### DQ Analysis

We can see here, that DAQO had an average daily return of 1.99% in 2017.
![DQ_Analysis_2018](DQ_Analysis_2018.PNG)

Here, we see a an average daily return of -0.626% in 2018.
These are green flags and normal movements for stocks--average daily return is +/-1%. Steve should keep an eye on 2018 and the most current numbers, since we do not want negative returns.
### All Stocks Analysis

Wow! 2017 gave DAQO an almost 200% return--the highest return of all the stocks Steven is analyzing for the year! 
![All_Stocks_2018](All_Stocks_2018.PNG)

We could have predicted, based on the 2018 DQ Analysis, that DAQO's return for 2018 would be lower than that of 2017---62.6%. Unfortunately, this is the lowest return of all of Steve's tickers for the year. For Steve's parents to have the best chance at diversifying their investment in green-energy, they could consider also buying stock in ENPH and RUN. These companies both showed postive returns in 2017 and 2018--the only two companies that did so.
